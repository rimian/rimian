Here are my Drupal Modules. 

Import Merge
----------------------------
Import Merge is a simple API module that loads data from a CSV file and delegates 
to other modules for merging with nodes, users, taxonomy or what ever you wish. 

The import_merge engine does the work of itterating through your data and delegating 
to callbacks to create, save or load data. After import_merge has the object it wishes
to merge available, it delegates to helper modules to do the merge.
